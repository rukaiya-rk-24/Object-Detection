# Object-Detection
Developed a high-performing object detection model that accurately detects over 100 objects in real-time, utilizing YOLO-v5 and Tensorflow. 
Implemented data augmentation techniques resulting in an increase of model accuracy by 15% when compared to industry-standard benchmarks. 
Optimized neural network architecture, resulting in a reduction of inference time by 25%, allowing for more efficient processing of objects. 
I have used the coco dataset for this model.
